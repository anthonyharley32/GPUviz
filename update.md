- Breakdown GPU
-Specify Tabs
-Basic GPUs with logo + name
-Don't show moving parts in mass items for loading.
-Everything in the same vector space so different tabs just move the POV in vector space.
-Items should be modular on building server and you should be able to select from a dropdown of different items with pictures.
-Text field on the side that goes along with what we're seeing and making the points we want to make.
-Set a vision using math to show how much cmopute is left on the table with idle personal computers and what that compares to modern clusters/superclusters.
-Usea bittensor blue not purple.
-Use abstraction where possible. Show just a rack for a server , just a building for a warehouse, etc.
-For the visualizations, let's show the numbers but focus on the ratio. So it would go from the compute possible by an iPhone -> Gaming PC -> Server Rack -> a machine learning cluster -> a supercluster like Colossus. This is what we want to demonstrate and hon the last section to explain how much compute was needed for the LLMs that we know how much they needed.
